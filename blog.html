            <p><span style="font-size: 10px;">need a reset on the back of my head:<br/>need to wake up every morning alone in my own bed,<br/>alone in my own bed.<br/>you know you’ll never break me glass,<br/>that’s why you’d rather me stone dead,<br/>you think of me dead.<br/>i’m not dead.<br/>i’m not dead. i’m living and<br/>trying to keep a bandage where you bit through the skin,<br/>but the humidity’s beginning to melt all the dye in,<br/>it melts all the dye in.<br/>the coffee hurts and i’m still upright but i wish i was lying,<br/>i wish i was lying down.<br/>i’m knocked down for the hour<br/>(now i’m feeling radioactive, will you ever feel ok?<br/>can you deal ok?)</span>
